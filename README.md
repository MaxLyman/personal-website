To start your Phoenix server:

  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

## Projects
  * Embedded Strava feed of my workouts
  - this will require the app to be exposed to the internet so i can make a webhook: 
    - https://developers.strava.com/docs/webhooks/ 
    - other than that it seems pretty simple to do. Just gotta get this thing hooked up with the url

  Later
  * RSS feed? combining updates to the Apple Maps Guide and Strava

 AWS DEPLOYMENT: 

STOPPING FOR NOW
just finished getting up a working ECR for the build image

both stages are fucked I think i need to add a login to the pre_build phase in the buildspec file for docker
adding my pwd and username to the secrets Manager 
working currently on the second pipeline of ECR->Codebuild->ECS 
then figuring out how to host it on max-lyman.com

 - launch a VPC 
 - Logically isolated part of the internet 
 - Public Subnet (range of IP that can be launced into)
 - (maybe) launch ECS into the Public Subnet 
 - Wrap the ECS in a security group which can dictate ingress and egress traffic
 - Internet gateway allows the ECS to go to the internet 
 - root table configures where your VM (ECS wants to go)
